# ADNI3 Imputataion preparation and some after imputation analysis
ADNI3 is genotyped with Illumina GSA array. Provided as the two sets of plink1.9 binary at LONI. We combined them together and split those with European ancestry, do some QC and impute it with Michigan Imputation Server. After imputation, we also conducted some post-imputation analysis.
